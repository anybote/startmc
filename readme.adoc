= startmc
Simple webserver for managing minecraft servers.

A lightweight HTTP server written in Go that provides REST endpoints to start, stop, and check the status of a Minecraft server running in a screen session.

== Installing

1. Ensure you have Go 1.21 or later installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Update the MC_SERVER_PATH env var in the startmc.service file
4. Install using one of these methods:
   * Run `make refresh` to install both the server and the systemd unit, you will be prompted for your password (this allows the server to restart if your computer restarts)
   * Run `make run` to run directly without installing, use the STARTMC_PORT env var and set it to 8080 if you don't want to run as root

== Uninstalling

1. Clone the repository
2. Use the make target:
   * Run `make uninstall` to clean and remove all files and units, you will be prompted for your password

== Usage

The server provides a simple HTTP interface to manage your Minecraft server instance.

Run the Minecraft server once first and agree to the EULA before using this utility to manage it.

=== Configuration

Configuration is handled through environment variables with sensible defaults:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Variable |Default |Description

|STARTMC_JAVA_PATH
|java
|Path to Java executable

|STARTMC_PORT
|80
|Port for the HTTP server to listen on

|MC_SERVER_PATH
|N/A (required)
|Path to Minecraft server directory

|MC_SCREEN_NAME
|mcserver
|Name of the screen session
|===

=== Endpoints

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Endpoint |Method |Description

|/
|GET
|Toggle server state (starts if stopped, stops if running)

|/status
|GET
|Get current server status
|===

==== Response Format

All endpoints return JSON responses in the following format:

[,json]
----
{
  "success": boolean,       // (optional) operation success status
  "is_running": boolean,    // current server running status
  "message": string,        // human-readable status message
  "error": string          // (optional) error message if something went wrong
}
----

== Dependencies

* Go 1.21+
* screen (Unix utility)
* Java Runtime Environment for running the Minecraft server
* Minecraft server jar file (EULA should already be agreed to)

== Future Work

It would be nice to support:
* Multiple Minecraft server versions, with the default being the latest
* Managed update of Minecraft server version
* Get last n lines of Minecraft server logs
* Send arbitrary commands to the Minecraft server
